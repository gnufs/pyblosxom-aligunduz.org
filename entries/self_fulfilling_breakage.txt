Self-fulfilling Breakage

<p>
I have just got this message in <a href="http://www.pidgin.im/">Pidgin</a> from a friend over the MSN Messenger Service:
</p>
<blockquote>"dude, my internet connection is fucked up. i'm getting disconnected every time i open msn."</blockquote>
<p>
Predictably, he was offline when i saw the message.
