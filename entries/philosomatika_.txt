I have just received this cool philosomatika t-shirt in the mail. And they were kind enough to leave a friendly note on the bill!

<a href="http://www.philosomatika.com/">Philosomatika</a> is an online radio station streaming uninterrupted <em>goa &amp; psychedelic trance</em>. Although I'm no aficionado of trance music, I mostly use this station as a background music while I do other things, especially hacking. It was a good purchase since the t-shirt seems very well printed and I have contributed to this independent radio station in the process.
