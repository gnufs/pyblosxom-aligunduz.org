High Quality OGG for "Trusted Computing"
#tags miro
<p>
I discovered the animated short film, <strong><a href="http://www.lafkon.net/tc/">Trusted Computing</a></strong>, today. Great movie! It is licensed under a Creative Commons (<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/sampling+/1.0/">Sampling Plus 1.0</a>) license that I wouldn't categorize as free but certainly more permissive than the standard copyrights. However, I was irritated by the lack of a truly high quality OGG video, whereas proprietary formats such as the Quicktime <em>.mov</em> had such quality copies.

Fortunately, I had the handy <tt><a href="http://v2v.cc/~j/ffmpeg2theora/">ffmpeg2theora</a></tt> tool at hand. It is a command line tool where entering a simple command encodes an OGG copy of the specified video file with default settings:
</p>
<p>
<tt>ffmpeg2theora video.mov</tt>
</p>
<p>
However, I wanted to have the highest quality possible. So, I entered the command with a <tt>-v</tt> argument
</p>
<p>
<code>ffmpeg2theora -v 10 video.</code>mov
</p>
<p>
where the number after <tt>-v</tt> defines the output quality in a scale from 0 to 10. (The default value is 5.) You can find more about the encoding options by entering "<tt>man ffmpeg2theora</tt>" or "<tt>ffmpeg2theora --help</tt>".
</p>
<p>
This produced a 66.3MB high quality video with Theora and Vorbis encodings. You can find the video file <a href="http://www.aligunduz.org/random/#TrustedComputing">here</a>.
