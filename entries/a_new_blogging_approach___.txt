a new blogging approach...
#tags miro
<p>
I have used this blog for project announcements until now. But considering <strong>a)</strong> I would like to blog more often and <strong>b)</strong> I am in a general stagnation with most of the projects I'm involved with, I think it's time to push the format a little to the micro blogging style. Also, I like the idea of casually sharing raw ideas and experiences that I deem relevant.

So, I'll try to post more often from now on. Let's see how it goes.
