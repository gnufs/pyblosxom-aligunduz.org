I regularly read a number of webcomics along with countless others that I stumble upon in my nightly cravings for more comics. Here are my favorites:
<h2><a href="http://xkcd.com/">xkcd</a></h2>

Okay, this is the most obvious one, since xkcd is arguably the most famous webcomic of the <em>geek</em> genre these days. Despite the corrosiveness of popularity, xkcd is continuing to be original and clever with minimal mediocrity.

I have been reading PHD comics since high school (yes, i see the irony) and it has always been a great companion for my moments of academic anxiety. However, the comics have transformed as the author, Jorge Cham, has finished grad school and became a professor. Nowadays, his comics mostly revolve around either more generalized topics of academia or the evolution of single characters. Still, it's a pleasure to read. If you are going to start reading, I highly recommend starting with the earlier strips.

Delightfully disgusting, Cy&amp;H tickles the most repulsive and perverted regions of the human brain. Although it can become repetitive at times, it's a great entertainment.

I have very recently found this gem of a comic. The drawings are absolutely amazing, and so is the sarcasm.
<h2><a href="http://www.wulffmorgenthaler.com/">Wulffmorgenthaler</a></h2>

Another comic strip I discovered recently, Wulffmorgenthaler's sense of humor generally comes from the hidden human misery of everybody. It's a time-proven technique that works great for its authors. It's a great daily read.
<h2><a href="http://www.geekherocomic.com/">Geek Hero Comic</a></h2>

This last comic of the list is not known for neither its artistic craftsmanship nor its brilliantly original ideas, but it is a fine representation of the GNU-centric computer culture. Geek Hero Comic tells the story of a group of hackers and their <em>holy war</em> against management and Microsoft-centric <em>drones</em> in the company they work for.
