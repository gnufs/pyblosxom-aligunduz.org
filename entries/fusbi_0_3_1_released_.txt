<h2>What is FUSBi?</h2>
FUSBi, the <em>Free USB Installer</em>, is a nifty, little application that creates bootable images of <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free</a> GNU/Linux distributions on USB drives (or hdd if you want).
</p>
<p>
You choose one of the supported distro releases, and FUSBi will automatically download the ISO image and create a bootable image of it on your USB drive. You can also simply use it with an ISO image you have already downloaded.
</p>
<p>
FUSBi supports all of the GNU/Linux distros recognized as free by the Free Software Foundation. These include <a href="http://www.gnewsense.org/">gNewSense</a>, <a href="http://www.ututo.org/www/">UTUTO</a>, <a href="http://dynebolic.org/">Dynebolic</a>, <a href="https://www.musix.org.ar/">Musix GNU+Linux</a>, <a href="http://www.blagblagblag.org/">BLAG</a> and <a href="http://livecd.gnustep.org/">GNUstep</a>.

<p>
* Some branding issues resolved.
<h2>Comments</h2>
The application is pretty stable. Any problems (if any) tend to occur around automatic download and distribution compatibility issues. Since this is a one-man project, testing with the numerous distros FUSBi supports is especially appreciated.

<p>
The source base, most of which is inherited from the UNetbootin, is far from being clean. It needs to be reordered and cleared from binary files.
