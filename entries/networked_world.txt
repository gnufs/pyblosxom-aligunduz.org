From <i>The Victorian Internet</i> by Tom Standage:

<blockquote>
As one writer put it in 1878, the telegraph "gave races of men in various far-separated climes a sense of unity. In a very remarkable degree the telegraph confederated human sympathies and elevated the conception of human brotherhood. By it the peoples of the world were made to stand closer together." The rapid distribution of new was thought to promote universal peace, truthfulness, and mutual understanding. In order to understand your fellow men, you really couldn't have too much news.<br>
Or could you? Not everyone wanted to know what was going in far-flung countries. The precedence given to what it saw as irrelevant foreign news over important local stories even lead the <i>Alpena Echo</i>, a small newspaper in Michigan, to cut off its daily telegraph service in protest. According to a contemporary account, this was because "it could not tell why telegraph company caused it to be sent full account of a flood in Shanghai, a massacre in Calcutta, a sailor fight in Bombay, hard frosts in Siberia, a missionary banquet in Madagascar, the price of kangaroo leather from Borneo, and a lot of nice cheerful news from the Archipelagoes - and not a line about the Muskegon fire." The seeds had been sown for a new problem: information overload.
